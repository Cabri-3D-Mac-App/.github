## 📊 Overview  

Cabri 3D is an interactive geometry application designed to explore, visualize, and construct three-dimensional mathematical objects. Built for educators, students, researchers, and STEM learners, it provides an intuitive workspace for understanding spatial relationships, geometric transformations, and solid structures through dynamic manipulation.

The software enables users to construct points, lines, planes, polygons, polyhedra, and curves, while maintaining real-time mathematical accuracy. Objects remain fully dynamic—modifying one element updates the entire construction—helping users develop deeper geometric insight and spatial reasoning.

Cabri 3D supports measurement tools, vector operations, transformations, projections, and analytic geometry components. With its clear interface and interactive visual approach, it’s valuable both for learning core geometry concepts and for preparing advanced demonstrations in classrooms or laboratories.
